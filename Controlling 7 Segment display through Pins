Peoject Materials;
1- STM32F429Z Discovery board
2- Anode display

In this mini-project, program is designed to show output on seven segment display by selected pins. Pins are HIGH in default and adjusted to LOW 
when present the desired output due to anode characteristic of seven segment display. Funcrional MACROs are built for one group due to
